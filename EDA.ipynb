    "# Workload Effect on Pitcher Injury\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal: \n",
    "Determine if we can find:\n",
    "1) Maximize the predictability of the probability of a pitcher getting injured\n",
    "2) A causal effect on pitcher injury (e.g., workload, less rest, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background:\n",
    "For our (1) goal, we want to predict the probability that a pitcher will get injured as a result of workload, rest (or lack thereof), distance traveled, etc. Essentially, given some features regarding what the pitcher has recently done, we can determine the probability that he'll get injured, should he play the next game. In a sense, we're trying to come up with a solution for teams', such that, based on the probability that results from the features we mentioned, a manager or top decision-maker would make judgdment (e.g., our probability induces a certain threshold such that meeting that threshold induces the idea of resting that pitcher instead of letting him pitch and risk an injury). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we understand that there is one glaring issue, and that is that there are many other confounding factors that induce an injury that might not necessarily *be* correlated with workload (e.g., the ball comes back to the pitcher and hits them and takes them out, the pitcher's form wasn't quite right and it caused an inury as a result of straining your body to come up with velo). To account for this, we want to focus on types of injuries that we are confident *are* correlated with workload, and we'll use scientific evidence to support this (e.g., torn UCL). The reason to avoid those other \"freak\" types of injuries is that they are a potential source of noise/bias as mentioned previously, some injuries are just not a result of workload, meaning it is entirely possible that our models could *learn* from these types of injuries and determine some kind of relationship with the probability of an injury, which we would not want. \n",
    "\n",
    "To approach this problem, we want to take a step back and view this problem from another lens. That being: Industrial Engineering. Essentially, we want to view pitchers as \"machines,\" and as a result, we want to estimate the \"failure\" rate (injury rate) of these \"machines\" as a function of workload cycles, rest, and travel. Meaning, we want to quantitatively come up with policies for the pitcher that are analogous to process optimizations. As we want to identify when the injury risk of these pitchers accelerate, such that we can prevent this *potential* injury in order to maximize pitcher usage, and minimize any waste, cost, or downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future iterations, we'd be interested in learning about *true* causal effects in terms of pitcher injuries, and whether or not the factors we talked about (e.g., workload, rest, etc.) have that kind of effect.\n",
